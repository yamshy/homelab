## Contributing

Thank you for contributing! Please follow these guidelines to help us keep quality high.

### Run validation before commit and PR
- Always run repo validation locally before committing or opening a pull request.
- In this repo, run from the repo root:

```bash
bash scripts/validate.sh
```

- If validation fails, fix the issues before proceeding.

### Pull requests
- Keep PRs focused and describe the rationale and testing steps.
- Ensure CI is green; do not merge on red.
- Update documentation and examples as needed.

### Commit messages
- Use clear, imperative subject lines (e.g., "Add X", "Fix Y").
- Reference related issues where applicable.
