# Context Rules

## Always Reference AGENTS.md

When working with this homelab Kubernetes infrastructure repository, always reference the `AGENTS.md` file for context about:

- Repository structure and architecture
- Development environment setup
- GitOps workflow with Flux
- Secret management with SOPS
- Troubleshooting procedures
- Code review guidelines
- Maintenance and update procedures

The `AGENTS.md` file contains comprehensive information about the codebase structure, tools, and best practices that should inform all development decisions and code suggestions.
